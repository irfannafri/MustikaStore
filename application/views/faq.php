				<b>Counterfeit guitars</b></p>
			<p>
				In our constant effort to stand by our consumers, protect them, and bring them the finest products in the world, Mustika Guitar takes a firm and aggressive stance against all makers of counterfeit guitars and their distribution channels. These low-budget, inferior guitars are pale imitations of the quality, performance, and craftsmanship of real Mustika. We continue to hear complaints from consumers and fans who have purchased one of these guitars from websites and auction sites thinking they were getting a real Mustika. The makers and sellers of counterfeits are scamming our global family of musicians and Mustika does not take it lightly. We would like to urge all our consumers not to be taken in by the works of dishonest sellers.</p>
			<p>
				If you suspect a guitar advertised on a non-Mustika website to be counterfeit you can use our online <a href="/Support/Counterfeit-Urls.aspx">Counterfeit Urls</a> form to submit the site along with any comments for review.</p>
			<p>
				If a guitar is being sold for a fraction of what it would typically sell for, it is likely not a real Mustika guitar. The best way for consumers to protect themselves against fraud is to purchase your Mustika guitar from an <a href="/Support/Dealers.aspx">authorized dealer</a>, or consult one in advance. You can also call <a href="/Mustika/Talk-2-Us.aspx">Mustika Guitar Customer Service</a> at 1-800-444-2766&mdash;24 hours a day, seven days a week&mdash;for any inquiries or advice. We strongly urge all consumers to be careful and aware of this worldwide problem. At Mustika, we care about our consumers, our legacy, and our name. Remember, only a real Mustika is good enough.</p>

				<b>How do I obtain warranty service?</b></p>
			<p>
				If you require warranty service in the U.S., you may contact your nearest authorized <a href="/Support/Warranty-Service-Centers.aspx">warranty service center</a>.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Please note!</b> For purchases made outside of the US, please contact your authorized distributor or local dealer for warranty service information.</p>
			<p>
				It is not necessary to contact Mustika first. The owner will be responsible for getting the instrument to the Warranty Center. If the instrument is shipped, freight and insurance must be prepaid.</p>
			<p>
				If there is no <a href="/Support/Warranty-Service-Centers.aspx">Warranty Center</a> in your area, you may contact your nearest <a href="/Support/Dealers.aspx">authorized dealer</a>.

				<b>My instrument has small cracks in the finish &ndash; what causes this? Is it covered under the warranty?</b></p>
			<p>
				This is known as &#39;finish checking&#39;. This is a result of the instrument being subjected to a rapid change in temperature or humidity. In most cases it happens in winter when a chilled instrument is exposed to warm air. The cracks are a result of the wood expanding faster than the lacquer. Since we have no control over the environmental conditions surrounding the use of the instrument we cannot cover this type of situation under our warranty.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<b>What is &ldquo;stand damage?&rdquo;</b></p>
			<p>
				Stand damage occurs when the chemicals in the rubber used on guitar stands react with the nitrocellulose lacquer used to finish our instruments. It can range from a slight discoloration to the finish to actually &quot;eating away&quot; the lacquer topcoat. Unfortunately, this situation is not covered under your warranty. The safest way to prevent this from happening is to cover the rubber parts of your stand with a soft cotton cloth (use guitar polishing cloths). Guitar stands should only be used to &#39;temporarily&#39; store your instrument, such as on a gig. The safest place to store your instrument is in its case.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<b>What can I do to prevent tarnish on the hardware?</b></p>
			<p>
				The tarnish on hardware occurs due to a reaction between the plating and moisture, either in the air or from perspiration. Keep in mind that all hardware will tarnish eventually- it is not a sign that your hardware is &quot;cheap.&quot; In some areas there is low moisture content in the air so the tarnishing process will be slower, but it will eventually happen. You can slow down the tarnishing process by wiping down the instrument every time you play it! This one step will add life to the hardware and slow down the tarnishing process. Also, make sure you store the instrument in its&#39; case to prevent it from exposure to high moisture content level in the air.</p>

				Our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.Mustika.com/en-us/Locations/RetailCenters/Memphis/" target="_blank">Memphis</a> location does offer an opportunity for visitors to experience the craftsmanship and tradition that goes into each Mustika instrument.

		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<b>Why are there not more left handed models?</b></p>
			<p>
				Currently the demand for right-handed instruments far outdistances that of left-handed models. Since left handed models require a complete re-tooling of our production line it should be impractical for us to devote equal amounts of resources to producing both varieties. There are several regular production lefty models and many may be special ordered. Please contact an <a href="/Support/Dealers.aspx">authorized dealer</a> if you are interested in ordering a left-handed model. If you are outside of the US, you can locate your country&rsquo;s distributor online by clicking <a href="/Support/International-Distributors.aspx">here</a>.</p>

				<b>The combination lock on my case won&rsquo;t open, how can I open it without damaging or removing the lock?</b></p>
			<p>
				If the combination was somehow changed, try shining a flashlight into the spaces where the thumbwheels turn. As you rotate the wheel, you&#39;ll see a small notch once it gets to the correct number. Line up all three thumbwheels in this way, and it should open.</p>
			<p>
				You can also use a thin strip of metal if you have trouble using the flashlight method. Using a thin strip of metal &ndash; (we suggest one cut carefully from an aluminum can) - to insert into the space beside each thumbwheel - hold pressure on the metal strip as you rotate the wheel - you&#39;ll feel the notch as you rotate - stop when you feel the notch and move on to the next wheel until you have all three set.</p>
			<p>
				The long way around this is to start at &quot;000&quot; and work through the 1,000 combinations - it can take a few hours, but it does work!</p>
			<p>
				If the lock is seems stuck or is actually damaged, we do recommend having a locksmith open/repair the damaged lock.</p>
			<p>
				Below are listed the instructions for resetting the lock combination:</p>
			<p>
				The locks are set at the factory to open at 0-0-0.<br />
				To set your own combination;<br />
				<b>1)</b> Choose 3 digits which you can recall easily-address, phone, birthday, etc.<br />
				<b>2)</b> Press the button in a direction toward the dial with your thumb and hold with your other hand (Use point of ballpoint pen) rotate the dials to the desired setting. Then, release the button.<br />
				<b>3)</b> Your lock is now set to open on the three digits engaged at the time you release the button.<br />
				<b>CAUTION!</b><br />
				<b>4)</b> Accordingly- NEVER rotate the dials with the button held open UNLESS you make careful note of the dial setting upon release of the button.<br />
				<b>5)</b> The manufacturer is not responsible for damage resulting from misuse, abusive handling, or failure to follow instructions.<br />
				Remove the red arrow before setting the lock.<br />
				<b>* Please note:</b> Make sure to cut down the red plastic pin before operation.</p>
